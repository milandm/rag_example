For given COBOL project module description in json format:

COBOL_project_module_description: $cobol_project_description

You should provide a Functional Specification Document based on the provided COBOL_project_module_description.

Functional Specification Document Creation Instructions:

You should create a Functional Specification Document based on the provided COBOL code explanation. 
This document should encapsulate: 
 - the functionality, 
 - logic 
 - internal interactions
 - external relations with external systems, subroutines, and modules
 
This document should include outline the steps to generate the corresponding Java code for the main program logic.

You should find these fields in COBOL_project_module_description:


    - BUSSINES LOGIC DESCRIPTION
    - BUSSINES LOGIC FEATURES LIST
    - FUNCTIONAL LOGIC DESCRIPTION
    - FUNCTIONAL LOGIC FEATURES LIST
    - variables list - name and description
    - errors edge cases list - description
    - dependencies list - name, description, input/output variables
    - declaratives - description
    - CHILD_NODES_BUSSINES_LOGIC_SUMMARIZATION - lower layers connected nodes summarized bussines logic description,
    - CHILD_NODES_FUNCTIONAL_LOGIC_SUMMARIZATION - lower layers connected nodes summarized functional logic description,
    - DEPENDENCY_NODES_BUSSINES_LOGIC_SUMMARIZATION - dependencies summarized bussines logic description,
    - DEPENDENCY_NODES_FUNCTIONAL_LOGIC_SUMMARIZATION - dependencies summarized functional logic description
    - GENERAL_INPUT_AND_OUTPUT_VARIABLES_LIST - inputs that should be given and outputs that we expect for this module, enlisted and explained
    - OVERALL_WORK_FLOW - overall workflow considering dependencies
    - variables_list - list of all variables used with names and descriptions
    - errors_edge_cases_list - list of all errors and edge cases covered by code implementation 
    - declaratives - additional error and edge cases covered
    - dependencies_list - all dependencies explained
  

Your document should include:

- title - "Functional Specification for:" give here brief description that fits in standard title
- subtitle -A descriptive subtitle and introduction to the functionality, one sentecne at most.
- external_calls - A section explaining each external call, its purpose, and how it integrates.
- internal_calls -A section detailing each code chunk call, including why and how the main block interacts with it.
- variables - A description of the variables, their roles, and their scopes.
- logic_flow - A comprehensive walkthrough of the logic flow, including conditionals, loops, any error handling, and overall program structure.
- overall_summarization - A conclusion summarizing the place and purpose of this module within the larger application.

Desired Outcome:

A well-structured and professional Functional Specification Document.
The length should be sufficient to cover all the details but concise enough to avoid redundancy ‚Äî typically ranging between 3-5 pages.
The format should be clear and organized, with headings, subheadings, bullet points, and diagrams (if necessary) to enhance readability.
The style should be formal and technical, suitable for a developer audience who may later use this document to recreate the logic in Java.

Example Output Format:

Title: 
Subtitle:

Introduction:
 Overview of this module purpose and high-level functionality.

External Calls:
 - ExternalCall1: Description and integration detail.
 - ExternalCall2: Description and integration detail.

Internal Calls:
 - InternalCall1: Description and interaction detail.
 - InternalCall2: Description and interaction detail.

Variable Declarations:
 - Variable1: Description and usage.
 - Variable2: Description and usage.

Logic Flow:
 Step-by-step walkthrough of this module logic.

Java Code Generation Steps Section:

Detail the process of translating this module logic into Java, including:

    Suggested architecture for modern Java app.
    Mapping of COBOL data types to Java data types.
    Conversion of COBOL specific structures to Java constructs.
    Handling file operations and database access in Java.
    Recommendations for replicating COBOL program cycle in Java (if applicable).

Conclusion:
 Summary of this module functionality and its relevance to the larger system.

Appendices:
 (If applicable, include any additional relevant diagrams, tables, or references.)

What to Ensure:

The document MUST reflect the provided COBOL project description accurately.
Technical terms should be used appropriately.
All assumptions about the external environment should be stated.
Cross-referencing within the document for variable usage and call flows is encouraged for clarity.
Clear, step-by-step instructions for the Java code generation.
Please proceed with the creation of the Functional Specification Document as per the instructions and details provided above.
